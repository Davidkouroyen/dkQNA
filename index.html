David Kouroyen: CAREGIVER AUTHORIZATION AFFIDAVIT


Q(1): When the parents of children are not able or available to provide care for their child, another person, often a family member, steps in to become the child's caregiver. 
One way for a person to become a child's caregiver without going through a court is Caregiver Authorization. Caregiver Authorization is when the parent or parents give the caregiver written permission to make educational and medical decisions.
A: Continue
	Q(1.1): A caregiver authorization form requires the signature of a parent, two witness signatures, and has to be notarized. The form itself only takes about ten minutes to fill out.
